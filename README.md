# Image-Classification

Objective:
The goal of this group project is to develop an image classification system using machine learning techniques. Each group member will contribute to the project by implementing and fine-tuning different aspects of the image classification pipeline.

# Workflow:

# Branching:

To maintain a structured development process, the main branch is protected. No direct pushes will be allowed to the main branch.
Every group member is required to create a new branch for their work and make a pull request to the main branch once their work is complete.

# Tasks and Contributions:

Assign specific image classification tasks to each group member. These could include preprocessing, model architecture, training, or evaluation.
Ensure that each member works on a separate aspect to parallelize development.
